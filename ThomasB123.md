### Encryption page ###


1. Interest of content.

Good - I personally am very interested in encryption and have done lots of work on it in the past, so I appreciate and approve of the content choice. Whilst the content is quite interesting, especially to me, I have to admit that it is lacking in quantity, with only two paragraphs in total.


2. Consistency and quality of visual presentation

Sound - It is good that you have used the same styles for the headers 'RSA cryptograhy' and 'The threat of quantum computing', although you have spelt 'quantum' incorrectly.
I like the image used to illustrate RSA encryption, although I think it should be larger so that the user can read the text on the image.
The navigation bar only has a valid link to the home page and one other member's page. This means that you cannot actually navigate around between the different pages, because even the home page doesn't have a link to this encryption page. There are no links anywhere on the other pages that link to this encyrption page.

3. Quality of written presentation

Sound - There are many spelling errors in this page: 'a-symetric', 'asymetric', 'indended', 'quamtum', 'sob-exponential', 'decipherd'. As well as grammatical errors such as "its" rather than "it's", and words at the start of a sentence are not always capitalised, such as the last sentence.

4. Validity of HTML

Outstanding - I ran the HTML through the w3 HTML checker and it only came up with one error, which was for the RSA image tag containing a 'width' attribute with no value, so that just needs to be removed. Apart from this one small error, the HTML is perfectly valid, which is outstanding.

5. Evidence of collaboration.
- Author info not written by author

Weak - There appears to be no information about the author of this page.

- Balanced contributions from members

Excellent - There appears to be a good balance in terms of the levels of contribution from all the different members of the group.

- Not completed at the last minute

Good - Looking at the commit history for the page, it was first committed 18 hours ago as of when I am reviewing this.
