# Barnaby Collins: Feedback

### Positive
-   Correctly implemented Bootstrap features such as navbar and col
-   Original content on all pages
-   Lovely name
-   encryption.html, drug_development.html and index.html share a consistent visual style
-   Mo.html has advanced styling and aesthetics, but this appears to have come from a pre-made Bootstrap template rather than scratch coding.

### Criticism
-   Mosub/Mo.html leaves me very confused and seems totally irrelevant
-   Navbar is missing links to some of the pages
-   Occasional spelling mistakes
-   Main website behaves well when resizing the page within reasonable limits

####    Interest of content: Good
>Content (on relevant pages) is original and interesting, though index.html leaves a bit to be desired and Mo.html still has questionable relation to the specification

####    Consistency and quality of visual presentation: Good
>Pages that are actually relevant share the same navbar and general style, and the site is fairly nice to look at.

####    Quality of written presentation: Good
>The content (where relevant) is original, written well and contains good formatting including bold keywords on drug_development.html. There are occasional spelling mistakes in one or two pages, but the website is otherwise good.

####    Validity of HTML: Excellent
>I was not able to find any errors in the HTML given a quick skim through the code.

####    Evidence of collaboration: Acceptable
>There is no author information, so I cannot give marks for that. All members have contributed, but some did less than others. The work was done over the course of the week that we were given, so they did well here.


### Summary

In summary, I think that this is a good website, with interesting content and good presentation. It is clear that some members of the team have worked to make sure that their pages turn out well. However, others seem to have treated this assignment as a bit of a joke and ended up making low-effort content that feels like it was designed just to get the assignment completed rather than to make a project of high quality.
