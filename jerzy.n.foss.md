ProgBoisWebsite Review
===========================
1. Interest of content
	* Excellent: information about several different impacts of technology in society
2. Consistency and quality of visual representation
	* Sound: some of the pages are very nice with a modern look. However, the blue titles on some pages are a bit difficult to read. In addition, the design is quite inconsitent depending on the page you are reading.
	* General recommendation: use a CDN rather than storing all the CSS on the site
3. Quality of written presentation
	* Good: Generally good. A couple of minor spelling and grammar mistakes
4. Validty of HTML
	* Weak: Most pages (except for index.html) throw errors on the w3 HTML validator
5. Evidence of collaboration
	* Sound: The repository commit log shows contributions from all members and most were days in advance of this review. However, there are no author bios on individual pages.
